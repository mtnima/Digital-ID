## Overview

The goal for this application is to enable a password-less authentication to Mautinania's e-Government portals, based on a biometric identity verification.

A secure, user-friendly, and privacy-preserving digital identity is a necessary precondition for Mauritania's e-Government services, as it enables trusted interactions between citizens, government authorities and the private sector. This need is recognised in the Digital Agenda 2022-2025, containing 10 Quick Wins as identified by Ministry of Digital Transition, Innovation and Public Sector Modernisation (MTNIMA) and the results of the joint United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and MTNIMA for Digital Readiness Assessment 2021.

To fulfil this, an RFP was published by UNDP for a Digital ID mobile application and a corresponding backend which was won by SmartMS, with TECH5 as the mobile application provider.
